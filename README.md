# fakebutton
<br>

Fake-Button connects to an API and displays a list of users defined by a specific candidate parameter. In addition to displaying this list of users, the app allows you to: 

* Create a new user (defined by the candidate parameter in use) 
* Create a transfer transaction for a specific user by specifying his `user_id`

The app's homescreen displays the list of users and contains a short form that allows for the creation of a new user. The floating action button opens up a dialog that is set up for conducting a transfer.
